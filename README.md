This is showing a way of constructing a tournament graph. It's not necessarily
the best way. The graph has two brackets; the normal bracket and a losers
bracket, effectively giving everyone in the tournament (except one!) the chance
to win even with one loss.

It produces a Graphviz dot file that will produce an image like below.
